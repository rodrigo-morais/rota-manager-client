# Rota Manager Client 

## Installation and running

All you need is `yarn && yarn start` to get the environment running. We recommend using node version 12+.

To see the application running visit http://localhost:8080
The API is served from http://localhost:3001, please visit this page to see the structure of returned data.

## Contents

This app loads data about upcoming shifts from the server and displays these data in a list. Server is implemented using fake [json server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

## Project Structure

The app is built in react. The main component `App` renders `ShiftsContainer` which then loads and displays the data. We're trying to follow smart container - dumb component approach, so that containers fetching the data do the minimum (or better zero) amount of presentation.

**Directory structure `./src`:**

`./actions` - files with dispatched actions for our store

`./features` - separate pieces of application

`./lib` - used for reusable code, e.g. api requests

`./reducers` - reducers for our redux store

### State management and side effects

We are using redux for storing the data fetched from the server. For dispatching actions we're using simple action files `.src/actions/...`. However we're not opposed to using simple component state when working on one of our tasks.

### Side effects

Side effects, in this case only api calls, are handled with [redux promise middleware](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware), for an example see `.src/reducers/shiftsReducer.js`.

### Api calls

For api calls we're using axios library. `.src/lib/requests/webapi.js` contains 2 api calls that we are / will be using.
